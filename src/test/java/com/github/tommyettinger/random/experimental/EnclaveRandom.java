/**
 * A distinct 64-bit random number generator that has both a state and a "gamma" value, which is similar to a key.
 * The gamma is determined by {@link EnhancedRandom#fixGamma(long, int)} with a threshold of 1. There are over a
 * quarter-billion sequential (odd) inputs to fixGamma() that produce distinct gamma values, all of which should be the
 * highest quality as measured by {@link EnhancedRandom#rateGamma(long)}. The gamma is used only to determine the change
 * in state between generations. The processing on the state involves two (fast) multiply-add operations, a bitwise
 * rotation in between them, and finishes with a xor-shift right. It uses two variables, x and y, where y is always
 * {@code x | 1} when used. This is 1-dimensionally equidistributed, with a different order of results for every
 * different gamma, but each result is still produces exactly once by {@link #nextLong()} over its period of 2 to the
 * 64. This passes Initial Correlation Evaluation tests and Immediate Initial Correlation Evaluation tests.
