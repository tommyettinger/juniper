/**
 * A random number generator that is optimized for performance on 32-bit machines and with Google Web Toolkit, this uses
 * only add, bitwise-rotate, and XOR operations (no multiplication). This generator is nearly identical to
 * {@link TrimRandom} in its structure, but uses smaller words (int instead of long), and has better avalanche properties.
 * <br>
 * The actual speed of this is going to vary wildly depending on the platform being benchmarked. It's hard to find a
 * faster high-quality way to generate long values on GWT (this is, surprisingly, faster than generators like
 * {@link FourWheelRandom} or {@link WhiskerRandom} on GWT at generating either int or long values, while this is likely
 * half the speed of FourWheelRandom when generating long values on Java 17 HotSpot). ChopRandom has a guaranteed
 * minimum period of 2 to the 32, and is very likely to have a much longer period for almost all initial states.
 * <br>
 * This generator can be considered stable. It passes 64TB of PractRand testing without anomalies.
 * <br>
 * The algorithm used here has four states purely to exploit instruction-level parallelism; one state is a counter (this
 * gives the guaranteed minimum period of 2 to the 32), and the others combine the values of the four states across three
 * variables. There's a complex tangle of dependencies across the states, but it is possible to invert the generator
 * given a full 128-bit state; this is vital for its period and quality.
 * <br>
 * It is strongly recommended that you seed this with {@link #setSeed(long)} instead of
 * {@link #setState(long, long, long, long)}, because if you give sequential seeds to both setSeed() and setState(), the
 * former will start off random, while the latter will start off repeating the seed sequence. After about 20-40 random
 * numbers generated, any correlation between similarly seeded generators will probably be completely gone, though.
 * <br>
 * This implements all optional methods in EnhancedRandom except {@link #skip(long)}; it does implement
 * {@link #previousLong()} and {@link #previousInt()} without using skip().
 * <br>
 * This is called ChopRandom because it operates on half the bits as {@link TrimRandom} while otherwise being similar.
