/**
 * A well-studied RNG that can be quite fast in some circumstances. This is a port of
 * <a href="https://romu-random.org/">Romu-Random</a>'s RomuTrio generator to Java. It has
 * three {@code long} states, which must never all be 0 but otherwise have no known restrictions.
 * <br>
 * RomuTrioRandom implements all optional methods in EnhancedRandom except
 * {@link #skip(long)} or {@link #previousLong()}.
 * <br>
 * It is strongly recommended that you seed this with {@link #setSeed(long)} instead of
 * {@link #setState(long, long, long)}, because if you give sequential seeds to both setSeed() and setState(), the
 * former will start off random, while the latter will start off repeating the seed sequence. After about 20-40 random
 * numbers generated, any correlation between similarly seeded generators will probably be completely gone, though.
 * <br>
 * The implementation here uses the algorithm from <a href="https://romu-random.org/">Romu-Random</a>, but bases its
 * implementation more closely on <a href="https://github.com/bgrainger/RomuRandom">this C# port</a>. The C# port by
 * Bradley Grainger is Apache 2.0 licensed, like jdkgdxds.
