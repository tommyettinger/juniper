/**
 * A variant on Java 8's SplittableRandom algorithm, removing the splittable quality so this has one possible stream.
 * You'd typically use this when you want every output of {@link #nextLong()} from one generator to be a different,
 * unique number until every {@code long} has been generated, such as for generating unique seeds or IDs. The reasons
 * for removing the splittable quality are a little complicated, but it's enough to say that by having a fixed stream,
 * this is a little faster, and it avoids the possibility of some streams being lower-quality. This uses Pelle Evensen's
 * <a href="https://mostlymangling.blogspot.com/2019/12/stronger-better-morer-moremur-better.html">Moremur mixer</a>
 * instead of SplittableRandom's Variant 13, which should give it roughly equivalent performance but somewhat higher
 * statistical quality. Like many variations on SplittableRandom and its SplitMix64 algorithm, this changes its state
 * by a simple counter with a large increment; one of the best increments seems to be (2 to the 64) divided by the
 * golden ratio, plus or minus 1 to make it odd. This number, 0x9E3779B97F4A7C15L or -7046029254386353131L when stored
 * in a signed long, shows up a lot in random number generation and hashing fields because the golden ratio has some
 * unique and helpful properties. The increment is sometimes called the "gamma," and this particular gamma is known to
 * be high-quality, but of the over 9 quintillion possible odd-number gammas, not all are have such nice properties
 * (for instance, {@code 1} would make a terrible gamma if it were used in this generator, because it's so small). We
 * only allow one gamma here, so we can be sure it works.
 * <br>
 * Other useful traits of this generator are that it has exactly one {@code long} of state, that all values are
 * permitted for that state, and that you can {@link #skip(long)} the state forwards or backwards in constant time.
 * It is also quite fast, though not as fast as {@link TricycleRandom} or {@link FourWheelRandom} on Java 16 or newer.
 * <br>
 * This class is an {@link EnhancedRandom} from jdkgdxds and is also a JDK {@link Random} as a result.
 * It can often be used as a substitute for {@link LaserRandom}. LaserRandom has comparable speed, and supports many
 * streams, but if you want just one {@code long} of state, DistinctRandom is a better fit. For higher speed on Java
 * 16 or higher, HotSpot, you can use {@link TricycleRandom} or {@link FourWheelRandom} (FourWheelRandom is preferred
 * if you only target Java 16+). Those generators also should have a longer period than DistinctRandom except in
 * infinitesimally-rare cases. No other generators in jdkgdxds have the "distinct" quality this generator has.
 * <br>
 * Unlike the multiple-state generators here, DistinctRandom tolerates being given sequential seeds and/or states, and
 * in fact doesn't randomize the seed when given one with {@link #setSeed(long)}. This is the only generator here that
 * performs two multiplications on its output (other than {@link Xoshiro256StarStarRandom}, which doesn't do much good
 * by multiplying by 5 and 9); having multiple large multiplications tends to mix bits very thoroughly as long as there
 * are some xorshifts or rotations between the multiplications.
 * <br>
 * This implements all methods from {@link EnhancedRandom}, including the optional {@link #skip(long)} and
 * {@link #previousLong()} methods.
