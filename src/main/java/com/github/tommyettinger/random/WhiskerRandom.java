/**
 * Typically the fastest generator here on recent JDKs, with a huge probable period but no minimum period guarantee.
 * This generator is extremely similar to {@link FourWheelRandom}; they use the same operations except for an additional
 * subtraction that FourWheelRandom uses. Removing this one operation, and changing the order of and constants used by
 * the other operations, improves both quality and speed here. This can be considered stable, like the other
 * EnhancedRandom implementations here. This generator is between 10% and 20% faster than FourWheelRandom on Java 16 and
 * up, including on Graal but not counting Semeru JDKs (which seem to be generally slower for all microbenchmarks).
 * <br>
 * Testing performed should be sufficient, but more can always be done; this passes at least 64TB of PractRand without
 * issues. This has been tested with Remortality, and it passes over 179 PB of that test without any suspect results.
 * {@link StrangerRandom} is not as fast; {@link TrimRandom} offers a guaranteed minimum period of 2 to the 64, but
 * isn't as fast, and may have statistical issues with some initial seeds sooner than it would with others.
 * <br>
 * The algorithm used here has four states just to exploit instruction-level parallelism; it isn't trying to extend the
 * period of the generator beyond about 2 to the 64 (the expected bare minimum, though some cycles will likely be much
 * longer). There's a complex tangle of dependencies across the four states, but it is possible to invert the generator
 * given a full 256-bit state; this is vital for its period and quality.
 * <br>
 * It is strongly recommended that you seed this with {@link #setSeed(long)} instead of
 * {@link #setState(long, long, long, long)}, because if you give sequential seeds to both setSeed() and setState(), the
 * former will start off random, while the latter will start off with a correlation between the initial a and c and the
 * results. The correlation should go away very quickly, though, probably in fewer than 10 generated numbers.
 * <br>
 * This implements all optional methods in EnhancedRandom except {@link #skip(long)}; it does implement
 * {@link #previousLong()} without using skip().
 * <br>
 * This is called WhiskerRandom because one of my cats would not let me finish this without giving him some attention.
 * The cat in question has very long whiskers, and is also very nimble.
