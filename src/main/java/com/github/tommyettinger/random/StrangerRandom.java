/**
 * A random number generator that acts as a counterpart to {@link FourWheelRandom} by guaranteeing a slightly longer period
 * and potentially being faster in some situations because it uses no multiplication. Like FourWheelRandom, this has four
 * {@code long} states, and is quite fast on desktop platforms (FourWheelRandom is about 25% faster, but both are very good).
 * It can be considered stable, like the other EnhancedRandom implementations here. I've tested this more than any other
 * generator I've written; it passes 64TB of PractRand, 5PB of hwd, and an absolutely massive amount of another test, remortality,
 * run on a GPU using CUDA. This last test was run while it was still a work in progress, but this class passed over 300PB after
 * over 500 hours.
 * <br>
 * The reason this has undergone so much testing is that it is built on top of some of the weakest random number generators
 * out there -- two interleaved 64-bit two-step xorshift generators, and some simple chaotic generators that incorporate the
 * results of those xorshift generators. This avoids multiplication entirely; the operations it uses are two xors, one left
 * shift, one unsigned right shift, one addition, two subtractions, and one bitwise rotation. It has a guaranteed minimum
 * period of (2 to the 65) - 2, and the actual minimum period is almost certainly higher (the guarantee comes purely from its
 * stateA and stateB, which interleave two periods of (2 to the 64) - 1; stateC and stateD extend this period by an unknown
 * amount). The xorshift generators are the absolute weakest generators of their kind -- they use constants of 7 and 9, which
 * are the only two full-period constants for a 64-bit xorshift generator. These only cause an avalanche of 4 bits to
 * change when one bit changes in their input, but this turns out to be more than enough for the chaotic stateC and stateD
 * generators. We ensure that stateA and stateB are sufficiently distant in their shared sequence by using a jump polynomial
 * on stateA to get a stateB that is {@code 0x9E3779B97F4A7C15} steps ahead of stateA (11.4 quintillion steps forward or 7
 * quintillion steps backward). The complicated calculations for the jump polynomial were done by Spencer Fleming; this was
 * not easy. This generator is meant in particular to optimize well for GPU computations, even though Java doesn't have much
 * ability to do this currently. Some uncommon platforms may also optimize this better than FourWheelRandom.
 * <br>
 * It is strongly recommended that you seed this with {@link #setSeed(long)} instead of
 * {@link #setState(long, long, long, long)}, because if you give sequential seeds to both setSeed() and setState(), the
 * former will start off random, while the latter will start off repeating the seed sequence. After about 20-40 random
 * numbers generated, any correlation between similarly seeded generators will probably be completely gone, though.
 * The setSeed() method isn't as fast here as it is in some other generators.
 * <br>
 * It implements all optional methods in EnhancedRandom except {@link #skip(long)} and {@link #previousLong()}.
