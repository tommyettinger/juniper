/**
 * A random number generator that is optimized for performance on 32-bit machines and with Google Web Toolkit, this uses
 * no multiplication and is identical to the published xoshiro128++ algorithm when generating {@code int} values. When
 * generating {@code long} values, it is a little different. The trick this uses for generating 64-bit values is to
 * separately scramble states A and D to get the uppermost bits (this is what generating an int normally does), then to
 * scramble states B and C differently to get the lowermost bits. This means a call to {@link #nextLong()} advances the
 * state exactly as much as {@link #nextInt()}, which is an uncommon trait for mostly-32-bit-math generators.
 * <br>
 * The actual speed of this is going to vary wildly depending on the platform being benchmarked. On GWT, which is the
 * main place where the performance of a random number generator might actually be a bottleneck in a game, this performs
 * very well, especially when producing {@code long} values. On desktop platforms, it is faster at generating
 * {@code int} values than {@code long}, which is to be expected for a 32-bit generator, but not as fast as some other
 * generators, like {@link ChopRandom}.
 * <br>
 * Xoshiro128PlusPlusRandom has a guaranteed period of {@code pow(2, 128) - 1}. For {@code int} outputs only, it is
 * 3-dimensionally equidistributed. For {@code long} outputs, equidistribution is unknown. It passes 64TB of PractRand
 * testing without anomalies (generating 64-bit numbers), and passes 2 to the 57.32 bytes of ReMort testing without
 * suspect results. ReMort is a very challenging test to pass for long sequences, so this result is encouraging, even if
 * the p-values dipped low in the middle of testing (they got better). This generator can be seen as a "safer
 * alternative" to {@link ChopRandom}, which is generally faster but has a lower minimum period and may have quality
 * issues that haven't yet been discovered. The Xoshiro family of generators is generally well-researched and most flaws
 * are already known and minor (with the PlusPlus scrambler, the only issue I know of is that this can't tolerate an
 * all-zero state). The way this generates 64-bit longs from a 32-bit generator is new and hasn't been tested by anyone
 * else, so it could have issues.
 * <br>
 * This implements all optional methods in EnhancedRandom except {@link #skip(long)}.
 * <br>
 * Based on <a href="https://prng.di.unimi.it/xoshiro128plusplus.c">this public-domain code</a> by Vigna and Blackman.
