/**
 * A faster and much-higher-quality substitute for {@link Random}. This allows many different random number
 * streams that don't overlap, and offers a more substantial API for commonly-used functions. This is not a
 * cryptographic random number generator, and should not be used in place of one.
 * <br>
 * This fills in much of the functionality of MathUtils in libGDX, though with all code as instance methods
 * instead of static methods, and some things renamed (randomTriangular() became {@link #nextTriangular()},
 * for instance, and random() became {@link #nextFloat()}). It also supplies some rare and sometimes-useful
 * code: {@link #skip(long)} allows "fast-forward" and "rewind" along with {@link #previousLong()} to simply
 * go back one step, you can get and set the exact state with {@link #getStateA()}, {@link #getStateB()},
 * {@link #setStateA(long)}, {@link #setStateB(long)}, and {@link #setState(long, long)} (which is useful
 * if you want to save a LaserRandom and reload it later), and there's bounded int and long generators which
 * can use a negative number for their exclusive outer bound ({@link #nextSignedInt(int)} and
 * {@link #nextSignedLong(long)}, plus overloads that take an inner bound). There's float and double
 * generators that are inclusive on both ends ({@link #nextInclusiveFloat()}, and
 * {@link #nextInclusiveDouble()}. There's {@link #nextGaussian()}, which is implemented differently from
 * java.util.Random and always advances the state once. This implements all optional methods in
 * EnhancedRandom, and implements almost all EnhancedRandom methods explicitly, which allows LaserRandom to
 * be copied more easily without depending on jdkgdxds (see below).
 * <br>
 * Every method defined in this class advances the state by the same amount unless otherwise documented (only
 * {@link #nextTriangular()} and {@link #nextTriangular(float)} advance the state twice). The state can
 * advance 2 to the 64 times before the sequence of random numbers repeats, which would take a few years of
 * continuous generation. There are also 2 to the 63 possible sequences this can produce; you can tell which
 * one you're using with {@link #getStream()}. Note, {@link Random} can only advance 2 to the 48 times, which
 * takes under half a day to make it repeat on recent laptop hardware while also analyzing the numbers for
 * statistical issues. This generator is more comparable to SplittableRandom, introduced in JDK 8 but not
 * available in Android (even with desugaring) or GWT currently. SplittableRandom also can produce 2 to the
 * 64 numbers before repeating the sequence, and also has 2 to the 63 streams, but it will always produce
 * each possible long value exactly once over the course of that sequence. Each of LaserRandom's streams
 * produces a different sequence of numbers with a different set of numbers it omits and a different set of
 * numbers it produces more than once; each of SplittableRandom's streams simply rearranges the order of all
 * possible longs. Though it might seem like an issue that a LaserRandom stream has gaps in its possible
 * output, if you appended all 2 to the 63 possible LaserRandom streams in full, the gargantuan result would
 * include all longs equally often. So, if the stream is selected effectively at random, then the subset of
 * that stream that actually gets used should be fair (and it's very unlikely that any usage will need a full
 * stream of over 18 quintillion pseudo-random longs). It is strongly recommended that you use very different
 * numbers when creating many LaserRandom objects with similar states, because there is a noticeable
 * correlation between, for instance, a grid of LaserRandom objects initialized with stateA drawn from the
 * odd numbers 1 through 101, and stateB drawn from another odd number 1 through 101. Using
 * {@link #setSeed(long)} essentially eliminates this risk, so it's a good idea to seed this with one long.
 * <br>
 * If statistical quality is a concern, don't use {@link Random}, since the aforementioned
 * analysis finds statistical failures in about a minute when checking about 16GB of output; this class can
 * produce 64TB of random output without a tool like PractRand finding any failures (sometimes it can't find
 * any minor anomaly over several days of testing). RandomXS128 has some flaws, though they are not nearly as
 * severe as Random's; mostly they are limited to a particular kind of failure affecting the least
 * significant bits (the technical name for the test it fails is a "binary matrix rank" test, which a wide
 * variety of related generators can fail if they don't adequately randomize their outputs). RandomXS128's
 * flaws would be permissible if it was faster than any competitors, but it isn't, and there have been two
 * improved relatives of its algorithm published since it was created. Both of these improvements,
 * xoroshiro128** and xoshiro256**, are slower when implemented in Java than LaserRandom (also when all are
 * implemented in C and compiled with GCC or Clang, typically). There are also some concerns about specific
 * failure cases when the output of xoroshiro128** or xoshiro256** is multiplied by any of quadrillions of
 * constants and tested after that multiplication (see M.E. O'Neill's dissection of xoshiro256**
 * <a href="https://www.pcg-random.org/posts/a-quick-look-at-xoshiro256.html">here</a>). Xoshiro256**, like
 * LaserRandom, can't be reliably initialized using nearby values for its state variables, and does much
 * better if you use its setSeed(long) method. We do implement Xoshiro256** here, because it provides
 * 4-dimensional equidistribution, and that is hard to find.
 * <br>
 * You can copy this class independently of the library it's part of; it's meant as a general replacement for
 * Random and also RandomXS128. LaserRandom is generally faster than RandomXS128, and can be over 3x faster
 * when running on OpenJ9 (generating over 3 billion random long values per second). If you copy this, the
 * only step you probably need to do is to remove {@code extends EnhancedRandom} from the class, since
 * almost all of EnhancedRandom consists of either default methods that this implements explicitly, or to
 * provide a common interface for pseudo-random number generators on the JVM. This class avoids using the
 * Override annotation specifically because copying the class and removing the EnhancedRandom implementation
 * would cause compile errors if Override annotations were present. If you do keep this class implementing
 * EnhancedRandom, then that permits some extra methods to come in via default implementations, like
 * nextExclusiveFloat() (which uses the BitConversion class here in jdkgdxds), minIntOf(), maxLongOf(), etc.
 * <br>
 * You may want to compare this class with TricycleRandom and FourWheelRandom in the same package; both of
 * those have a larger state size (and should usually have a larger period), are usually faster, and also
 * implement all of EnhancedRandom (except for {@link #skip(long)}), but they do even less randomizing for
 * the first result they return, so if the seeding has a pattern, then the start of their sequences will
 * have patterns. These patterns are less obvious but do persist in LaserRandom, and don't persist in
 * TricycleRandom or FourWheelRandom over a long run. All generators here do well when using
 * {@link #setSeed(long)} to set the full state.
 * <br>
 * Pew pew! Lasers!
