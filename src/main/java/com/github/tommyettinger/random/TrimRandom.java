/**
 * A random number generator that is very fast on Java 16+, has both a very large probable period and a large guaranteed
 * minimum period, and uses only add, bitwise-rotate, and XOR operations (no multiplication). This generator is not quite
 * as fast as {@link FourWheelRandom} on machines that can multiply {@code long} values efficiently, but is faster than
 * just about everything else (except {@link TricycleRandom} and {@link DistinctRandom} on Java 8 with HotSpot, or
 * DistinctRandom on any OpenJ9 version). If this algorithm is run on a GPU, on most hardware it will be significantly
 * faster than FourWheelRandom (indeed, it was faster than any other algorithm I tested on a low-end GPU).
 * <br>
 * This can now be considered stable, like the other EnhancedRandom subclasses here. Testing performed should be
 * sufficient, but more can always be done; this passes at least 64TB of PractRand without issues, and passes a much more
 * rigorous single test ("remortality," which measures how often the bitwise AND/bitwise OR of sequential numbers become
 * all 0 bits or all 1 bits) through over 150 PB. The test in question runs on the GPU using CUDA, so was able to generate
 * far more numbers in a timeframe of days than most CPU approaches could. Earlier versions of remortality incorrectly
 * measured byte length and reported a higher size, so reports of 1 exabyte by earlier versions are roughly equivalent to
 * 150 petabytes now. This is still a tremendous amount of data.
 * <br>
 * This was changed a few times; when the algorithm could be strengthened, I took the chance to do so. The most recent
 * change made the first number returned a little more robust; where before it was always the incoming value of
 * {@code stateC} (which would change for the next returned number, but not the current one), now it is the outgoing
 * value of {@code stateC}, which is slightly-less obviously-related to one state only. The first result of
 * {@link #nextLong()} incorporates states A, B, and C, but not D; the second and later results will incorporate
 * {@code stateD}. This doesn't seem to have any performance penalty, and may actually improve performance in some cases.
 * <br>
 * The algorithm used here has four states purely to exploit instruction-level parallelism; one state is a counter (this
 * gives the guaranteed minimum period of 2 to the 64), and the others combine the values of the four states across three
 * variables. There's a complex tangle of dependencies across the states, but it is possible to invert the generator
 * given a full 256-bit state; this is vital for its period and quality.
 * <br>
 * It is strongly recommended that you seed this with {@link #setSeed(long)} instead of
 * {@link #setState(long, long, long, long)}, because if you give sequential seeds to both setSeed() and setState(), the
 * former will start off random, while the latter will start off repeating the seed sequence. After about 20-40 random
 * numbers generated, any correlation between similarly seeded generators will probably be completely gone, though.
 * <br>
 * This implements all optional methods in EnhancedRandom except {@link #skip(long)}; it does implement
 * {@link #previousLong()} without using skip().
 * <br>
 * This is called TrimRandom because it uses a trimmed-down set of operations, purely "ARX" -- add, rotate, XOR.
