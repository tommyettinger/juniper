/**
 * An unusual RNG that's extremely fast on HotSpot JDK 16 and higher, and still fairly fast on earlier JDKs. It has
 * three {@code long} states, which as far as I can tell can be initialized to any values without hitting any known
 * problems for initialization. These states, a, b, and c, are passed around so a is determined by the previous c, b is
 * determined by the previous a, b, and c, and c is determined by the previous b. This updates a with a multiplication,
 * b with two XOR operations, and c with a bitwise-left-rotate by 41 and then an addition with a constant. If you want
 * to alter this generator so results will be harder to reproduce, the simplest way is to change the constant added to
 * c -- it can be any substantially-large odd number, though preferably one with a {@link Long#bitCount(long)} of 32.
 * <br>
 * Other useful traits of this generator are that it almost certainly has a longer period than you need for a game, and
 * that all values are permitted for the states (that we know of). It is possible that some initialization will put the
 * generator in a shorter-period subcycle, but the odds of this being a subcycle that's small enough to run out of
 * period during a game are effectively 0. It's also possible that the generator only has one cycle of length 2 to the
 * 192, though this doesn't seem at all likely. TricycleRandom implements all optional methods in EnhancedRandom except
 * {@link #skip(long)}; it does implement {@link #previousLong()} without using skip().
 * <br>
 * This is closely related to Mark Overton's <a href="https://www.romu-random.org/">Romu generators</a>, specifically
 * RomuTrio, but this gets a little faster than RomuTrio in some situations by using just one less rotation. Unlike
 * RomuTrio, there isn't a clear problematic state with a period of 1 (which happens when all of its states are 0).
 * This is often slightly slower than RomuTrio, but only by a tiny margin. This generator isn't an ARX generator any
 * more (a previous version was), but its performance isn't much different (like RomuTrio, the one multiplication this
 * uses pipelines very well, so it doesn't slow down the generator).
 * <br>
 * TricycleRandom passes 64TB of testing with PractRand, which uses a suite of tests to look for a variety of potential
 * problems. It has also passed a whopping 4 petabytes of testing with hwd, can test a much larger amount of data but
 * only runs a single test. The test hwd uses looks for long-range bit-dependencies, where one bit's state earlier in
 * the generated numbers determines the state of a future bit with a higher-than-reasonable likelihood. All the
 * generators here are considered stable.
 * <br>
 * It is strongly recommended that you seed this with {@link #setSeed(long)} instead of
 * {@link #setState(long, long, long)}, because if you give sequential seeds to both setSeed() and setState(), the
 * former will start off random, while the latter will start off repeating the seed sequence. After about 20-40 random
 * numbers generated, any correlation between similarly seeded generators will probably be completely gone, though.
