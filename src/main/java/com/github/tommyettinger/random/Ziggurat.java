/**
 * An implementation of the Ziggurat method for generating normal-distributed random values. The Ziggurat method is not
 * an approximation, but is faster than some simple approximations while having higher statistical quality. This is not
 * an ideal implementation; it cannot produce as wide of an output range when compared to normal-distributing methods
 * that can use an arbitrarily large supply of random numbers, such as Marsaglia's Polar method. Unlike those methods,
 * this only uses one long as its input. This will randomize its input if it reaches a condition that would normally
 * require the Ziggurat algorithm to generate another random number.
 * <br>
 * Every bit in the input long may be used in some form, but the most important distinctions are between the bottom 8
 * bits, which determine a "box" for where the output could be drawn from, the upper 53 bits, which form into a random
 * double between 0 and 1, and bit 9 (or {@code (state & 512L)}), which is treated as a sign bit. If any of these bit
 * ranges contains some value more often than other values that should be equally likely, it can manifest as an output
 * defect. Further, generating values in the trail takes more time than other values, and that can happen most
 * frequently when bits 0 through 7 of {@code state} are all 0.
 * <br>
 * The range this can produce is at least from -7.6719775673883905 to 7.183851151080583, and is almost certainly larger
 * (only 4 billion distinct inputs were tested, and there are over 18 quintillion inputs possible).
