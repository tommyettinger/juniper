/**
 * A random number generator that is extremely fast on Java 16, and has a very large probable period.
 * This generator is measurably faster than {@link TricycleRandom} on Java 16 but slightly slower than it on Java 8.
 * It can be considered stable, like the other EnhancedRandom implementations here. Testing performed should be sufficient,
 * but more can always be done; this passes at least 64TB of PractRand and 2PB of hwd without issues. The second test, hwd,
 * only checks for a specific type of quality issue, but also fails if the period is exhausted; going through 2 to the 52
 * bytes of data (taking over a week to do so) without exhausting the period should be a strong sign that it will have
 * enough period for most tasks. While this is known to fail one test ("remortality," a check for how long it takes for the
 * bitwise AND/OR of sequential results to reach all 0 bits or all 1 bits), it takes 300PB of data processed to reach
 * a failure point, which is astronomically more than most apps will ever produce. {@link StrangerRandom} is probably
 * stronger, but not as fast; {@link TrimRandom} is much stronger but also not quite as fast as this class (it is close).
 * <br>
 * The algorithm used here has four states purely to exploit instruction-level parallelism; it isn't trying to extend the
 * period of the generator beyond about 2 to the 64 (the expected bare minimum, though some cycles will likely be much
 * longer). There's a complex tangle of dependencies across the four states, but it is possible to invert the generator
 * given a full 256-bit state; this is vital for its period and quality. State A and state B operate like a staggered LCG
 * that starts with stateD; this part is why 2 to the 64 is expected as the bare minimum period. State C and state D take
 * two of the other states and combine them; C rotates state B and subtracts state D, while D simply XORs states B and C.
 * This returns the state D that the previous step generated. This performs better than TricycleRandom simply because each
 * of the states can be updated in parallel (using ILP) and all the updates depend on either one or two states, instead
 * of one, two, or three with TricycleRandom.
 * <br>
 * It is strongly recommended that you seed this with {@link #setSeed(long)} instead of
 * {@link #setState(long, long, long, long)}, because if you give sequential seeds to both setSeed() and setState(), the
 * former will start off random, while the latter will start off repeating the seed sequence. After about 20-40 random
 * numbers generated, any correlation between similarly seeded generators will probably be completely gone, though.
 * <br>
 * This implements all optional methods in EnhancedRandom except
 * {@link #skip(long)}; it does implement {@link #previousLong()} without using skip().
