/**
 * A generator with 4 {@code long} states and a guaranteed minimum period of 2 to the 64, this is structured much like
 * WhiskerRandom and is almost as fast. In each call to {@link #nextLong()}, this performs 5 different operations: add a
 * constant, subtract two variables, multiply by a constant, XOR two variables, and bitwise-rotate one variable (this is
 * one hardware instruction on desktop JVMs and probably many others). None of these operations have any data dependency
 * on each other, so all of nextLong() can be performed with instruction-level parallelism when available. That's how,
 * on a laptop, this can produce 1.6 billion longs per second when ThreadLocalRandom can only produce about 940 million
 * longs per second (and ThreadLocalRandom uses JVM-internal variables, too).
 * <br>
 * Quality-wise, this does very well in testing. It passes 64TB of PractRand with no anomalies, and has passed 89PB of
 * the ReMortality test with a strong final result (7.97358e-01, a one-sided p-value where close to 1.0 is best). This
 * isn't cryptographically secure (at all), but as a non-cryptographic generator it does the job. While WhiskerRandom
 * has only a very small chance of randomly finding an unusually short cycle (short enough to exhaust in, say, a month),
 * ScruffRandom has no chance of finding such a short cycle, since all of its cycles have lengths that are multiples of
 * 2 to the 64 (which currently takes longer than a month to exhaust on one machine, though if you attacked a generator
 * using a top-notch GPU, you could get close... if you happened to find a cycle with an incredibly low multiple).
 * <br>
 * The name continues the theme of WhiskerRandom, naming generators after where my cats like to get scratched.
