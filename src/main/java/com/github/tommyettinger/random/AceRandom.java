package com.github.tommyettinger.random;

/**
 * Like TrimRandom with five 64-bit states; does not use multiplication, only add, subtract, XOR, and left-rotate
 * operations. Has a state that runs like a counter, guaranteeing a minimum period of 2 to the 64. This passes roughly
 * 180 petabytes of intensive testing on the GPU with ReMort, as well as 64TB of PractRand's broad spectrum of tests.
 * It can sometimes be the fastest generator here, outpacing {@link WhiskerRandom} on Java 19 on occasion, but it isn't
 * quite as fast as Whisker on older JDKs. Whisker doesn't have a guaranteed minimum period, though, and this is
 * usually faster than {@link PasarRandom}, another 5-state generator with a minimum period of 2 to the 64. The maximum
 * and/or expected periods for both PasarRandom and AceRandom are far larger than they would need to be, even if run for
 * decades on current hardware. The minimum period alone would take multiple years to exhaust if using a CPU, much less
 * to find that particular cycle with the shortest period. Running on a fast GPU would take less time, but still an
 * impractically long time.
 * <br>
 * The name comes from the 52 cards (excluding jokers, but including aces) in a standard playing card deck, since this
 * uses a left rotation by exactly 52 as one of its critical components. Rotations by anything else I tried didn't pass
 * testing as well, or even at all.
