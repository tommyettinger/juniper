/**
 * A variant on Java 8's SplittableRandom algorithm, removing the splittable quality so this has one possible stream,
 * but using the statistically-strong <a href="https://github.com/jonmaiga/mx3">MX3</a> mixer instead of a variant on
 * Murmurhash 3's mixer (like SplittableRandom and {@link DistinctRandom}). Like with DistinctRandom,
 * you'd typically use this when you want every output of {@link #nextLong()} from one generator to be a different,
 * unique number until every {@code long} has been generated, such as for generating unique seeds or IDs. This is
 * somewhat slower than DistinctRandom, but it can tolerate seeding at any point in its generation, to any different
 * (not-yet-used) seed, and produce outputs that are not correlated to other seeds.
 * <br>
 * Other useful traits of this generator are that it has exactly one {@code long} of state, that all values are
 * permitted for that state, and that you can {@link #skip(long)} the state forwards or backwards in constant time.
 * It is also fairly fast.
 * <br>
 * This class is an {@link EnhancedRandom} from juniper and is also a JDK {@link Random} as a result.
 * Besides DistinctRandom, no other PRNGS in juniper have the "distinct" quality, but most of the "Quasi-Random"
 * generators do have it as well.
 * <br>
 * Unlike the multiple-state generators here, DistinctRandom tolerates being given sequential seeds and/or states, and
 * in fact doesn't randomize the seed when given one with {@link #setSeed(long)}.
 * <br>
 * This implements all methods from {@link EnhancedRandom}, including the optional {@link #skip(long)} and
 * {@link #previousLong()} methods.
