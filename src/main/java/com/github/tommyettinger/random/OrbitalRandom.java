/**
 * A hash-on-counters RNG with a period of 2 to the 128.
 * This is closely related to {@link FlowRandom}, but gives up the
 * arbitrary {@link #skip(long)} feature and the various stream manipulation methods to have a
 * much longer period and become 1-dimensionally equidistributed.
 * <br>
 * Uses the Moremur unary hash (the same one as {@link DistinctRandom} and FlowRandom), passing it a
 * combination of the two different additive counters this has for its state. One counter is rotated
 * before XORing with the other, which replaces a xorshift in the original. The first counter only
 * adds the same large odd number at each step, but the second counter adds both a different large
 * odd number and the result of {@link BitConversion#countLeadingZeros(long)} on the first state.
 * This way of mixing the states means while the first counter on its own has a period of 2 to the 64,
 * the second counter is very slightly offset from being in-sync with the first, and since it depends
 * upon the first counter, its period is 2 to the 128.
 * <br>
 * This passes 64TB of PractRand without anomalies. In most regards, it should have similar
 * statistical qualities to FlowRandom, except that it is guaranteed to produce each possible long
 * value exactly (2 to the 64) times. Unlike DistinctRandom, it is not possible to figure out the
 * current state given one output, and it would take an unknown amount of additional outputs to
 * retrieve the current state exactly. It shares this quality with FlowRandom.
 * <br>
 * You would probably want to use this generator when you want a known, large period and to be
 * reliably random from the first output regardless of the initial state. Using a
 * {@link Xoshiro256StarStarRandom} gets the first (with a period
 * of 2 to the 256, minus 1), but not the second. Using a
 * {@link Xoshiro256MX3Random} gets you most of both (and a period of 2 to the 256, minus 1), but
 * it can't be seeded with all 0 states, which could be a burden, and it's slower than this. Both
 * of those generators offer 4-dimensional equidistribution, whereas this only offers
 * 1-dimensional, and that might be a deciding factor.
