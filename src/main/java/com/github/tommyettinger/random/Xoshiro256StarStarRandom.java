/**
 * A random number generator that is fairly fast and guarantees 4-dimensional equidistribution (with the exception of the
 * quartet with four zeroes in a row, every quartet of long results is produced exactly once over the period). It has a
 * period of (2 to the 256) - 1, which would take millennia to exhaust on current-generation hardware (at least).
 * It can be considered stable, like the other EnhancedRandom implementations here. This passes heavy testing, but isn't a
 * cryptographic generator, and it does have known issues when its output is multiplied by certain specific constants (any
 * of a lot) and tests are then run. The only invalid state is the one with 0 in each state variable, and this won't ever
 * occur in the normal period of that contains all other states. You should generally seed this with {@link #setSeed(long)},
 * rather than {@link #setState(long, long, long, long)}, because if you give similar states to the latter, it tends to
 * produce severely flawed output on at least the low-order bits. This can't happen with setSeed().
 * <br>
 * The main reasons you could prefer this generator to the typically-faster {@link FourWheelRandom} are:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>This generator is 4D equidistributed, so groups of four coordinates will always be unique.</li>
 *     <li>This generator is well-studied and appeared in a paper.</li>
 *     <li>You will never use Java 16, and if you use Java 17, you would rather use the implementation in the JDK there.</li>
 *     <li>You need a regular structure to the generated numbers, with guarantees about that structure.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * This implements all optional methods in EnhancedRandom except {@link #skip(long)}; it does implement
 * {@link #previousLong()} without using skip().
 * <br>
 * Xoshiro256** was written in 2018 by David Blackman and Sebastiano Vigna. You can consult their paper for technical details:
 * <a href="https://vigna.di.unimi.it/ftp/papers/ScrambledLinear.pdf">PDF link here</a>.
