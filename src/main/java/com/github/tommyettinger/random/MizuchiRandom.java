/**
 * A relatively-simple RNG that's similar to {@link LaserRandom} with less correlation between similar initial states,
 * but without the ability to {@link #skip(long)}. It has two {@code long} states, one of which changes with every
 * generated value and one always-odd state which never changes (the "stream"). This uses a linear congruential
 * generator for its changing state (the state changes by multiplying with a large constant and adding the stream), and
 * feeds the resulting value to a small, simple unary hash to get a more-random result.
 * <br>
 * This always has a period of 2 to the 64, and there are 2 to the 63 possible sequences that result from changing the
 * stream value. MizuchiRandom implements all optional methods in EnhancedRandom except
 * {@link #skip(long)}; it does implement {@link #previousLong()} without using skip().
 * <br>
 * MizuchiRandom passes 64TB of testing with PractRand, which uses a suite of tests to look for a variety of potential
 * problems. It has not been tested with hwd or remortality. All the generators here are considered stable.
 * <br>
 * The name comes from combining the concept of a dragon, with streams. A mythological theme was carried throughout some
 * generators that I designed and that were designed by others, such as Fortuna. Mizuchi allows many possible streams, so
 * the mizuchi, a (by some versions of the story) river dragon from Japanese mythology, seemed fitting.
 * <br>
 * This is present here for two reasons. First, it can be used in cases where similar initial states are expected to be
 * given to a two-state generator like LaserRandom (visible patterns are obviously correlated with LaserRandom but are
 * not at all correlated with MizuchiRandom). Second, MizuchiRandom is often the fastest 64-bit generator available in
 * the closely-related C# library ShaiRandom, and for compatibility purposes it makes sense to support this in both.
 * This generator is not especially fast here compared to LaserRandom, especially on OpenJ9, nor is it fast compared to
 * FourWheelRandom on HotSpot JDKs, but it does maintain its quality well.
