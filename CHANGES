[0.3.9]
- Updated dependency on digital to 0.4.0 .
- Updated LineWobble with several new methods, such as splobble(), quobble(), and hobble().

[0.3.8]
- Updated dependency on digital to 0.3.7 .
- InterpolatedRandom is new.

[0.3.7]
- [SEED BREAKING CHANGE] Ziggurat had its outputs change in some rare cases, which should now make it more "fair." This only affects Gaussian and/or normal-distributed variables, or things that consume them.
- Added Xoshiro256MX3Random .
- Add a cipher, SpeckCipher, as a learning exercise; don't use it please!
- Add leap() to some random number generators.

[0.3.6]
- Immediately replaced by 0.3.7 .

[0.3.5]
- Updated dependency on digital to one that will work on GWT (digital 0.3.3).

[0.3.4]
- Fixed ArchivalWrapper serialization.
- Fixed Distribution.equals() in the presence of unused parameters, which are NaN.

[0.3.3]
- Fixed deserialization for ZipfianDistribution and made it use double for its alpha parameter (since it could only be set by giving a double).

[0.3.2]
- [SEED BREAKING CHANGE] AceRandom and ScruffRandom's `setSeed(long)` method now have much less correlation between the seed and the first few outputs of the generator. This does change the results of `setSeed(long)` and the constructor with one long that calls it.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] TupleQuasiRandom now uses a Weyl sequence (the same as GoldenQuasiRandom) instead of a simple counter that only adds 1. This changes all results, especially with small seeds.
- ArchivalWrapper's deserialization works now when a Base is specified.
- LongSequence.with() had a severe bug relating to resizing the backing array, which should be fixed now.

[0.3.1]
- Added ReverseWrapper, which wraps another generator and makes calls to nextLong() become calls to previousLong() and vice versa.
- Added LongSequence, KnownSequenceRandom, and ArchivalWrapper, which are all closely-related.
- Added ScruffRandom, which has 256 bits of state, a guaranteed minimum period of 2 to the 64, and is quite fast/high-quality. It does use multiplication, like WhiskerRandom.
- Added TupleQuasiRandom, which cycles through 1024 different multipliers that it applies to the upper bits of a counter. I am not sure what it might be useful for just yet.

[The Before Times]
- Lots of stuff.
