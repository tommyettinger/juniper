[0.3.2] [SNAPSHOT]
- [SEED BREAKING CHANGE] AceRandom and ScruffRandom's `setSeed(long)` method now have much less correlation between the seed and the first few outputs of the generator. This does change the results of `setSeed(long)` and the constructor with one long that calls it.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] TupleQuasiRandom now uses a Weyl sequence (the same as GoldenQuasiRandom) instead of a simple counter that only adds 1. This changes all results, especially with small seeds.


[0.3.1]
- Added ReverseWrapper, which wraps another generator and makes calls to nextLong() become calls to previousLong() and vice versa.
- Added LongSequence, KnownSequenceRandom, and ArchivalWrapper, which are all closely-related.
- Added ScruffRandom, which has 256 bits of state, a guaranteed minimum period of 2 to the 64, and is quite fast/high-quality. It does use multiplication, like WhiskerRandom.
- Added TupleQuasiRandom, which cycles through 1024 different multipliers that it applies to the upper bits of a counter. I am not sure what it might be useful for just yet.

[The Before Times]
- Lots of stuff.
